# Password Generator

This Python script generates random passwords based on user preferences for length and character types (alphabetical, numerical, and special symbols).

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `password_generate.py`.
2. Enter the desired length for your password when prompted.
3. The script will generate a random password containing a mix of alphabetical characters, numbers, and special symbols.
4. You can choose to generate another password or quit.

## How It Works

- The script prompts the user to input the desired length of the password.
- It ensures that the password length is at least 8 characters.
- Random characters are selected from three categories: alphabetical, numerical, and special symbols.
- The final password is displayed to the user.
- The user can choose to generate another password or quit the program.

## Example

```bash
========== PASSWORD GENERATOR ==========

Enter the length of your password: 12

Lt7%bZpV$0rQ

Enter 'g' to generate again 'q' to quit: g

Oe1@pLw~2oQd

Enter 'g' to generate again 'q' to quit: q
```
## Notes
Ensure that you choose a password length of at least 8 characters for better security.
The generated passwords include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
